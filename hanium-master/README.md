### Disaster Response and Safety Management System Using Aduino
In the event of an emergency situation such as a ship accident, we felt the need to establish a system for identifying the location of crew members to ensure safety management. In the event of an accident, we thought we needed a space to ask the first person about questions related to the ship by automatically reporting the ship and informing the crew of the instructions for action.
